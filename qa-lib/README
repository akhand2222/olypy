mapgen-lib was originally generated by Stephen using the mapgen
Olympia utility, and was subsequently extensively edited by hand.  For
example, when modifylib adds new items, they may collide with existing
locs and gates, so I have renamed many mapgen ids to ones that
don't collide.

modified-lib is generated by ../modifylib.py from mapgen-lib. This
is the defaultlib for the sim.
