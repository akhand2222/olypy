[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olympiag3/olypy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olympiag3/olypy) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/olympiag3/olypy/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/olympiag3/olypy?branch=master) [![Apache License 2.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/olympiag3/olypy.svg)](LICENSE)

olypy is a collection of code related to the game Olympia, which
currently lives in SVN (yuck) at

https://sourceforge.net/projects/olympiag3/

Eventually olypy will be good enough to support two main
activities:

* Generating a game database for testing the Olympia code
* Generating a game database from turn output to support simulations

It is my hope that simulations can be delivered to all game
players.
