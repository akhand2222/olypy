# olypy

olypy is a collection of code related to the game Olympia, which
currently lives in SVN (yuck) at

https://sourceforge.net/projects/olympiag3/

Eventually olypy will be good enough to support two main
activities:

* Generating a game database for testing the Olympia code
* Generating a game database from turn output to support simulations

It is my hope that simulations can be delivered to all game
players.
